# CycleDetection
My solution for CPT 212 Algorithm Design and Analysis group assignment function 2: cycle detection

The algorithm is meant to detect and print all cycles in a graph, including the nested cycles without repeatition. 

Feel free to ask me questions, I'd like to show off how smart I am. ðŸ˜Ž

Thank you for informing me the bugs you have found, I did it for my assignment not for myself LOL.

A lot of improvements can be done, feel free to use the codes.
